# Overview

## Landscape

Today's identity providers, identity verification services, banks, and other
core services that perform some degree of Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and/or
Know-Your-Business-Partner (KYBP) services on their customers operate in a
predomintrustantly issuer-centric, phone-home world: today's web [2.0] and
mobile-app ecosystems are almost 100% powered by API phone-homes and delegation
tokens. This is gradually changing, though: third party cookies are being
replaced by more nebulous (and platform-centric) tracking models, reducing the
centrality of identity providers in the web advertising ecosystem. In parallel,
user-centric approaches are increasingly putting cryptocurrency private keys and
sensitive identity data directly in user-controlled wallets. The role of an
identity provider is shifting, along with their phone-home mechanisms, user
experience expectations, and business models. The next big thing is portable
identity, user-controlled sharing, and trustless, universally-verifiable tokens.
Verite provides a standards-driven approach for empowering your end-users
without assuming new risks and liabilities.

If you want your end-users to be able to present a [revocable,
tightly-controlled] "badge" that proves them to be your customers anywhere such
a badge grants them access to better products and validated-customer prices, you
want to be issuing them Verite credentials. Which exact form that takes depends
on the answers to a few key questions:

1. What use-cases do you want to start with? [Overview of use-cases](#Use-cases)
1. What liability are you comfortable holding for the credentials you issue?
   [Liability and Auditing
   Considerations](#liability-and-auditing-considerations)
1. What kind of wallets is it strategic for you to support? [Wallet Overview](#Wallet-Overview)
1. Is the issuance/wallet-interaction something you want to "build or buy"?
   [Architectural options](#architectural-options)

## Use-Cases

In the short-term, the following use-cases are going live in at least one product offering in 2022:

1. VC-based gating of KYB status and domicile (US y/n) for a "company wallet"
   (i.e., Compliant and Auditable Institutional DeFi)
1. VC-based gating of Investor Accreditation for a "company wallet" (US-domiciled wallets)

The following are in research and design phase, being co-developed by participants and adopters:

1. KYC'd individual wallet (custodial and self-custodial)
1. Non-US KYB status (including interoperability with GLEIF and FincID credentialing)
1. FATF-compliant reporting for custodial-to-custodial transactions (incl
   custodial-to-noncustodial transactions)
1. Currency controls/FX reporting
1. Verifiable credit-assessment and forensics-sourcing

## Liability and Auditing Considerations

Each Verite credential type represents a different liability surface and
lifecycle. When designing your Verite engagement, consider the following
variables:

- What are the "semantics" (functional content) of each credential you are considering issuing?
  - KYB credentials basically say "I know this wallet to be controlled by a
    company that I have KYB'd according to the linked standard", no more and
    no less
  - Accredited Investor credentials are essentially the same, linking to a
    different process definition standard
  - FATF reporting requires legal entity information to be verifiable and
    anchored in auditing and/or registration authorities; the liability
    considerations are more complex for _relying on_ these credentials than
    issuing self-attested (non-repudiable) ones
- Which customers will you issue these portable credentials to?
- What can you safely assume about the wallets you are issuing to?
- How do you want to link your logging and record-keeping for these credentials
  to your core identity systems and business model? We recommend storing a copy
  of every VC you ever issue, in a way that can be easily queried at scale at
  least by UUID or other unique per-credential key.

_A note on "Uptime"_: particularly if you are issuing credentials that may need
to be revoked quickly, you should consider whether you are operationally
equipped to maintain (24/7, 365) monitoring of real-world data sources like OFAC
and PEP lists. Most IDV companies have some kind of realtime monitoring that
triggers "push" notifications to clients when statuses change, but with
portable, self-certifying credentials like Verite, you don't know whom to push
that notification to-- instead, you have to comply with the low
latency-tolerance of publishing credential status updates to "revocation lists".

## Wallet Overview

Take a minute to ask yourself some difficult strategic questions:

- Depending on your business model, you may be more interested in supporting
  "identity wallets" (applications for signing contracts, handling sensitive
  identity documents, providing verifiable consent, etc) or in supporting
  "cryptocurrency wallets" (that authorize transactions on cryptocurrency
  blockchains and "web3" applications).
- You might be interested in supporting only cryptocurrency wallets with full
  "identity wallet" functionality, or interested in separating the two concerns
  in two distinct pieces of software. (Our sample implementation may provide a
  useful starting point for this latter approach! A browser-extension for
  identity functionality to complement a cryptocurrency wallet is coming soon).
- Retail wallets tend to have long, slow upgrade cycles and governance
  processes. Conversely, many companies contract out to wallet firms to provide
  highly-customized "provisioned wallets" to their employees for managing
  company funds. As Verite capabilities are standardized and rolled out as
  common APIs, these may be a better match for "testing the waters"
- Depending on which exact credentials you issue and your risk tolerance, you
  might have different requirements for identity-assurance,
  sybil-resistance/uniqueness, deduplication, or liveness/biometric binding.
  I.e., if your use-case requires you to be certain that the authorized employee
  is authorizing each transaction of a company wallet, you may want to limit
  your support to wallets with built-in per-transaction or per-session
  biometrics, etc.


## Architectural options

At present, the two main options to consider are whether you want to attest to
the controller of an _blockchain address_ or to the controller of a specific
_wallet_, which may control multiple addresses in addition to a DID (wallet
identifier). For more information, read the
[identifier scheme considerations](https://verite.id/verite/patterns/identifier#wallet-based-versus-address-based-holder-identification-schemes)
and compare the
[address-bound credential exchange flow](https://verite.id/verite/patterns/verification-flow#address-bound-verification-flow)
and the
[wallet-bound credential exchange flow](https://verite.id/verite/patterns/verification-flow#wallet-bound-verification-flow)
.

For address-bound flows, please see

for implementation guidance and code examples, and
[Wallet Connect request presentation](https://verite.id/verite/developers/supporting-wallet-connect#presentation)
for reference.

For wallet-bound flows, please see the pages on
[wallet-bound issuance mechanics](https://verite.id/verite/developers/issue-a-verifiable-credential)
and [wallet-bound issuance service setup](https://verite.id/verite/developers/issuer-setup)
for implementation guidance and code examples, and

for reference.

Once you have clear your use-cases and your high-level architecture, you arrive
at the build-or-buy decision. If you want to issue the credentials you will be
responsible for yourself, there are tutorials and documents to guide you through
the process in the ["For Developers" section of this
site](https://verite.id/verite/developers/getting-started).
