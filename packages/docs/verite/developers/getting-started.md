# Getting Started

Verite has provided several interactive demos as well as sample projects to showcase some use-cases of the Verite standards. The code is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/circlefin/verite). To run all of the demos, you will need code found in two repositories: `verite` and `demo-wallet`.

1. Setup and run Verite's [verite](https://github.com/circlefin/verite/blob/main/README.md)
2. Setup and run Verite's [demo-wallet](https://github.com/circlefin/verite/blob/main/packages/wallet/README.md)
3. Select a demo in verite to be guided through the steps

The `verite` repository also hosts several standalone code samples to assist in developing your own solution. Those samples are located at:

- `packages/demo-issuer`
- `packages/demo-verifier`
- `packages/demo-revocation`
