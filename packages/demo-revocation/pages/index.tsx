            This is a simple example of how revocation works using{" "}
            <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-status-list-2021/">
              Status List 2021
            </a>
            . The revocation status is essentially stored in a compressed and
            encoded bitstring, with each credential having its own index. If the
            bit at the index is a 1, the credential is revoked. Otherwise, it is
            not revoked.
          </p>
          <p>
            To simplify the demo, everything is performed within the browser. In
            a production environment:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Both the Credential and the Revocation List Credential would be
              issued by the issuing service
            </li>
            <li>
              Revocation List Credential would be served from a URL, as
              referenced in the credential status.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clients would determine whether a credential was revoked by first
              fetching the credential from said URL and then checking its
              revocation status.
            </li>
            <li>
              Revoking / Unrevoking a credential would require an authenticated
              API call to the issuing service, e.g. from a compliance agent.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When revoking and unrevoking a credential. Notice that the
            Revocation List Credential changes, but the KYC credential does not.
